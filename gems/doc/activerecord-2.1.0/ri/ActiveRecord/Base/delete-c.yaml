- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Delete an object (or multiple objects) where the <tt>id</tt> given matches the primary_key. A SQL <tt>DELETE</tt> command is executed on the database which means that no callbacks are fired off running this. This is an efficient method of deleting records that don't need cleaning up after or other actions to be taken.
