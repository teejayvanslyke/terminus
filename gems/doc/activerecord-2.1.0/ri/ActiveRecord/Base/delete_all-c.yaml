- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Deletes the records matching <tt>conditions</tt> without instantiating the records first, and hence not calling the destroy method and invoking callbacks. This is a single SQL query, much more efficient than destroy_all.

- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST

  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>conditions</tt> - Conditions are specified the same way as with <tt>find</tt> method.
  type: :BULLET

  text: Example
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Post.delete_all &quot;person_id = 5 AND (category = 'Something' OR category = 'Else')&quot;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This deletes the affected posts all at once with a single DELETE query. If you need to destroy dependent associations or call your before_ or after_destroy callbacks, use the <tt>destroy_all</tt> method instead.
