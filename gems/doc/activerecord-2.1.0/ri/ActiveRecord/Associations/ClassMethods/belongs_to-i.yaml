- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Adds the following methods for retrieval and query for a single associated object for which this object holds an id: <tt>association</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so <tt>belongs_to :author</tt> would add among others <tt>author.nil?</tt>."
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association(force_reload = false)</tt> - Returns the associated object. <tt>nil</tt> is returned if none is found.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association=(associate)</tt> - Assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, and sets it as the foreign key.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>association.nil?</tt> - Returns <tt>true</tt> if there is no associated object.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>build_association(attributes = {})</tt> - Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key, but has not yet been saved.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>create_association(attributes = {})</tt> - Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt>, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that has already been saved (if it passed the validation).

  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Options are:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:class_name</tt> - Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_one :author</tt> will by default be linked to the Author class, but if the real class name is Person, you'll have to specify it with this option.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:conditions</tt> - Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be included as a <tt>WHERE</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>authorized = 1</tt>.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:select</tt> - By default, this is <tt>*</tt> as in <tt>SELECT * FROM</tt>, but can be changed if, for example, you want to do a join but not include the joined columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise it will raise an error.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:foreign_key</tt> - Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the association with an &quot;_id&quot; suffix. So a class that defines a <tt>belongs_to :person</tt> association will use &quot;person_id&quot; as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>. Similarly, <tt>belongs_to :favorite_person, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Person&quot;</tt> will use a foreign key of &quot;favorite_person_id&quot;.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:dependent</tt> - If set to <tt>:destroy</tt>, the associated object is destroyed when this object is. If set to <tt>:delete</tt>, the associated object is deleted <b>without</b> calling its destroy method. This option should not be specified when <tt>belongs_to</tt> is used in conjunction with a <tt>has_many</tt> relationship on another class because of the potential to leave orphaned records behind.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:counter_cache</tt> - Caches the number of belonging objects on the associate class through the use of <tt>increment_counter</tt> and <tt>decrement_counter</tt>. The counter cache is incremented when an object of this class is created and decremented when it's destroyed. This requires that a column named <tt>#{table_name}_count</tt> (such as <tt>comments_count</tt> for a belonging Comment class) is used on the associate class (such as a Post class). You can also specify a custom counter cache column by providing a column name instead of a <tt>true</tt>/<tt>false</tt> value to this option (e.g., <tt>:counter_cache =&gt; :my_custom_counter</tt>.) When creating a counter cache column, the database statement or migration must specify a default value of <tt>0</tt>, failing to do this results in a counter with <tt>NULL</tt> value, which will never increment. Note: Specifying a counter cache will add it to that model's list of readonly attributes using <tt>attr_readonly</tt>."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:include</tt> - Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this object is loaded.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:polymorphic</tt> - Specify this association is a polymorphic association by passing <tt>true</tt>. Note: If you've enabled the counter cache, then you may want to add the counter cache attribute to the <tt>attr_readonly</tt> list in the associated classes (e.g. <tt>class Post; attr_readonly :comments_count; end</tt>)."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:readonly</tt> - If true, the associated object is readonly through the association.
